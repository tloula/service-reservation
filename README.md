Westchester Bible Church Service Seat Reservation API

As churches begin to reopen for in-person services after COVID-19, many churches are choosing to impose a limit on their service capacity in order to stay well within their government guidelines.

This web API provides a means for individuals to reserve seats for their group, and records expected attendence for each service. If a particular service is full, it alerts the user and recommends that they reserve seats in a different service.
